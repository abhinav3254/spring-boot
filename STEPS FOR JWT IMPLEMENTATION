					STEPS FOR JWT IMPLEMENTATION




1. Add the dependency for the jwt
2. create an endpoint that needs to be secured inside the controller.
3. Create a bean for the InMemory user and put the password inside that 
  and also the authentication manager This should be annotated with the @Cofiguration.
4. @Component JWTAthenticationEntryPoint This method is called when an authentic user tries to touch our API.
5. Now create a JWTHelper all the JWT token creation and other jwt related methods are defined.
6. Now create a class @Component JWTAuthenticationFilter which extends OncePerRequestFilter this method basically 
  called each and every time when client makes a request this class checks for the token each and every 
  time when client makes any request.
7. Now make @Configuration class for the method @Bean SecurityFilterChain here mention each routes 
   that needs to be protected and which not may be present in the public for everyone to access.
8. Now in Controller class Make the /login with POST mapping.
